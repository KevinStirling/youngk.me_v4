# Writer of code, drinker of seltzer 🥤

When I am not building full stack web applications for **[Throtle](https://throtle.io/)**, I can be found creating things with the **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)**, **[Go](https://go.dev)**, and whatever new tech catches my eye.

I write about my experiences making games and web technology on my **[blog](/blog)**!
